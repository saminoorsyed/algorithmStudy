The following repository is my place to log, store and share my continuing study of algorithms.

Each folder (aside from algoAssign) is dedicated to a specific problem solving Methodology, 
and contains within it a few examples, in their separate files, of problems and the algorithms that solve them efficiently.

At the top of each file, there is an explanation of the algorithmic question posited. This explanation is followed by a commented (usually) function definition, and finally at the bottom of every page there are 1 to many test cases that can be run to check the solutions. rather than designing exhaustive test cases, I opted to write one to a few tests simply to illustrate how each function works and their outputs

after the test cases, some algorithms may have notes on how the code might be improved. usually I try to implement those improvements when I think of them, so those notes may be far and few between

Some of these Problems I have encountered on the hacker rank website, the leetcode website, or in my readings of Jeff Erickson's excellent and free text book "Algorithms" which can be found here http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/.
